    <h3>Preparation Time: 45 minutes | Cooking Time: 1 hour | Serves: 6 people</h3>
                
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Rice</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the basmati rice thoroughly until the water runs clear. Soak it in water for 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, bring 8 cups of water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add salt, cumin seeds, cloves, cinnamon stick, and bay leaves to the boiling water.</li>
        <li>Add the drained rice and cook until it's 70% done (partially cooked). This usually takes about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain the rice in a colander and set aside. Be careful not to overcook the rice as it will continue cooking during the final assembly.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Step 2: Marinate the Meat</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix yogurt, ginger paste, garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken (or mutton) pieces and coat them thoroughly with the marinade.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably 3-4 hours or overnight for best results.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Curry Base</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the green cardamom pods, black cardamom pods, star anise, and black peppercorns. Saut√© for 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced onions and fry until they turn golden brown, about 10-12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the marinated meat along with the marinade and cook on high heat for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add chopped tomatoes and green chilies. Cook for another 5 minutes until tomatoes soften.</li>
        <li>Add potatoes and cook for 5 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Cover and simmer on low heat for about 25 minutes for chicken (45 minutes for mutton) until the meat is tender and the gravy thickens.</li>
        <li>Add half of the chopped coriander and mint leaves. Mix well.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Step 4: Prepare the Saffron Milk</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak saffron strands in warm milk for 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

<h3>Step 5: Assemble the Biryani</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In the same pot with the meat curry (or transfer to a larger pot if needed), spread half of the partially cooked rice evenly over the curry.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle half of the fried onions and some more chopped coriander and mint leaves.</li>
    <li>Add the remaining rice on top, creating a second layer.</li>
    <li>Pour the saffron milk evenly over the rice.</li>
    <li>Top with the remaining fried onions, coriander, and mint leaves.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 6: Final Cooking (Dum Cooking)</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. For a better seal, you can place dough around the edges of the lid (traditional method) or use aluminum foil and then the lid.</li>
    <li>Cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes. This slow cooking process, known as "dum," allows the flavors to meld together.</li>
    <li>Once done, let it rest for 10 minutes before opening.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 7: Serving</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Gently mix the layers, ensuring you don't break the rice grains.</li>
    <li>Serve hot with raita (yogurt dip), salad, and lemon wedges.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Important Tips for Perfect Sindhi Biryani:</h3>
<h4>Tip & Description</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Rice Quality= Use aged, long-grain basmati rice for best results. The grains should remain separate after cooking.</li>
    <li>Meat Cut= Bone-in meat pieces add more flavor to the biryani. For chicken, use a mix of drumsticks, thighs, and breast pieces.</li>
    <li>Spice Level= Adjust the number of green chilies according to your spice tolerance. Authentic Sindhi Biryani is typically quite spicy.</li>
    <li>Dum Cooking=The final slow cooking step is crucial for melding flavors. Use a heavy-bottomed pot and low heat to prevent burning.</li>
